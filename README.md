# 🚀 Space Invaders 🚀

A retro-style **Space Invaders** game clone developed in **Java** using **Swing** and **AWT**.  
Control the ship, shoot aliens, and survive with limited bullets.  
Fun and simple mechanics – with automatic wave generation and difficulty increase!
I built this game seeing a youtube video to learn how to build a game using java and swing.I modified many of its feature like limited bullet number added restart button and i will try more feature infuture.
